When I to decide take over reins of my life in my hands was stunned and enlightened by a new horizon before my eyes. So many programming languages, work methods, mindsets, people to talking and share kinda ideas. Honestly, it’s scared me a lot for months. Maybe around 1 year.

IT is a giant knowledge area and we have to decide which way to go. New languages, methods, ideias/concepts. I really didn’t know what was waiting for me in the job market and it’s scared me.

My experience revolved around HTML 4.01 and CSS 2 until 3 or 4 years ago. Now, in the early 2018, I’m better coder and man. I’ve thousands of wishes and things to do (learn). But, I can and should to keep my mental health and choose what to study.

My advice to new coders: keep calm and the answer is 42. LOL Just kidding a bit. Be aware the market but choose who you want being. Read a lot, study, communicate, talk to other professionals. Be nice with everyone who are cool. Be patient. And… be yourself.

Oh yeah… Participate in events in your expertise area and why not others too!
